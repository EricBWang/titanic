# Titanic Survival Predictor
The titanic survival predictor is a classification project developed to identify relevant factors for passenger survivability through core ideas of data mining and analytics: ensemble learning, feed forward neural networks, decision trees, logistic regression. 

Results
A feed forward neural network that predicted passenger survivability with 77.5% accuracy suggests that age, cabin number, and other features were pertinent
Found correlations between passenger class, cabin number, and their respective survivabilities
Procedure
Imputation via regex text manipulation and mean values, one hot encoding for relevant categorical variables
Compared logistic regression model versus decision tree and neural network with varying hyperparameters and features (i.e. max iterations or max depth)
